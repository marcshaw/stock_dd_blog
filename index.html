                <p class="summary">Quantum Computing Inc faces devastating fraud allegations from short sellers Iceberg Research and Capybara Research, who claim the company fabricated revenue, misrepresented NASA relationships, and operates a fake TFLN foundry. Despite generating only $263,000 in annual revenue while burning tens of millions, QUBT raised $1.64 billion in 2025 and commands a $2.6-3.8B market cap—over 10,000x sales. With 10+ securities law firms pursuing class action lawsuits, an auditor shut down by the SEC for massive fraud, and management exodus with insider selling at peak prices, QUBT represents either the most brazen quantum computing fraud or an extremely early-stage photonics bet trading at an absurd valuation.</p>

                <p class="summary">Roblox faces a critical crossroads as explosive user growth (70% YoY DAU increase to 151.5M) collides with mounting regulatory scrutiny over child safety failures. The platform generates strong free cash flow ($443M in Q3 2025) despite GAAP losses, but trades at a premium 17.9x sales valuation that leaves no room for error. With state Attorneys General filing lawsuits calling the platform a "hunting ground for predators" while Wall Street maintains 78% buy ratings, RBLX represents a binary bet on whether management can win a two-front war: fixing platform safety while growing into its massive valuation.</p>

                <p class="summary">POET Technologies makes optical interconnect engines that enable AI data centers to transmit data at light speed, addressing critical bandwidth bottlenecks in GPU-to-GPU communication. The company recently secured $225M in capital through two oversubscribed offerings and landed its first $5M production order for 800G optical engines, signaling a transition from development to revenue generation. With a sub-$900M market cap targeting a multi-billion dollar photonics market and institutional investors paying premium prices, POET represents a high-risk, high-reward bet on the infrastructure powering AI's exponential growth.</p>
